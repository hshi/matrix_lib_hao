matrix_lib_hao
==============

The c++ matrix library, it supports many dimension array and uses lapack blas libaray. We can use both mkl, acml, and magma (CPU+GPU). There is a customed acml.h (not 64, not mp version) header file for using acml.

NOTE: To enable MAGMA support, specify `-DUSE_MAGMA=on' option when running cmake.

Acknowledgment:
Yudistira Virgus (https://github.com/yvirgus ) and Wirawan Purwanto(https://github.com/wirawan0) contributed to the Magma part. Only the function part of Magma is imported to current library. They even use the polymorphism class to switch between Magma and normal lapack/blas, which can be found from Yudistira's github. 

The reason I only adopt the function part:
1. It is more readable and understandable.
2. GPU is still on its way, we might need to update the code more, it is easy to update the function.
3. We have CPU and GPU, there is no 'TPU' or 'VPU', I do not see a big advantage of polymorphism class here.
However, anyone who is interested in the polymorphism class, and want to use it, please check https://github.com/yvirgus/matrix_lib_hao for more details.
